I want to integrate grafana into my current project to my current project. 
grafana should read data from the ingestion-schema and display information like an historic graph, daily stats etc. (show me what you can come up with and think is relevant)
make sure to read my documentation BEFOREHAND for infos about the projects quirks, features and helpful commands and please dont hesitate to ask my if you have ANY questions. 
also make sure to read some data from the db to get a feel of how the data looks. 
the stack is entirely controlled over docker so make sure to look in the docs for commands. 
The grafana dashboard should be pre-configured so that the dashboard does not need to be configured manually. 
also its only test data in the db so the newest data is from the end of october or something so be wary of that. 
if you need a grafana folder create in in the project root
if you need to add new env variables be sure to keep to the structure in the .env.example file and then mirror the changes over to the .env file
all changes should be made to both compose files but keept there respective roles and differences intact.
all the docs are located in the @docs directory
