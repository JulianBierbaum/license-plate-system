# Production Deployment Guide

This guide outlines the steps for deploying the License Plate Recognition System in a production environment.

## 1. Prerequisites

*   A server or cluster with Docker and Docker Compose installed.
*   A Docker registry containing the images for all the services. See the [Building and Pushing Docker Images](building-images.md) guide for more information.
*   A PostgreSQL database. You can run the database in a Docker container, as shown in the `docker-compose.prod.yaml` file, or use a managed database service.

## 2. Configuration

Create a `.env` file on the production server with the appropriate environment variables for your production environment. You can refer to the [Configuration](../getting-started/configuration.md) guide for a complete list of variables.

**Important:** Ensure that you use strong, unique passwords for all database users and other secrets. Do not use the default development passwords.

## 3. Docker Compose for Production

The `docker-compose.prod.yaml` file is provided as a starting point for production deployments. This file is similar to the `dev` version, but it uses the images from the Docker registry instead of building them locally, and it does not mount the source code volumes.

You can use this file directly or adapt it to your needs. For example, you might want to use a different container orchestrator like Kubernetes.

## 4. Deployment Steps

1.  **Copy `docker-compose.prod.yaml` to the server:** Transfer the `docker-compose.prod.yaml` file to your production server.
2.  **Create the `.env` file:** Create a `.env` file on the server with your production configuration.
3.  **Log in to the Docker registry:** If your Docker registry requires authentication, log in using the `docker login` command.
4.  **Start the application:** Use Docker Compose to start the application in detached mode:

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml up -d
    ```

This will pull the required images from your Docker registry and start all the services.

## 5. Reverse Proxy and SSL

For a production deployment, it is highly recommended to use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Traefik) in front of the web service. This will allow you to:

*   **Use a custom domain name.**
*   **Enable SSL/TLS** to secure the communication between the users and the application.

The reverse proxy would typically listen on ports 80 and 443 and forward the traffic to the `web-service` container on port 3000.
